# Design Document: Databricks DataOps Platform

## 1. Overview

The primary objective of this platform is to automate the deployment of Databricks resources while strictly protecting the integrity of **Staging** and **Production** environments. By employing a **Colocated DAB Pattern**, we solve the critical issue of resource duplication—preventing scenarios where dashboards or jobs with identical names are accidentally published or overwritten. This system utilizes **GitHub Actions** to orchestrate a robust CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that every change is validated, versioned, and promoted through a structured lifecycle.

## 2. Environment Strategy & Isolation

The platform utilizes a three-tier architecture to isolate development from business-critical assets:

* **Sandbox**: Personal development areas where unique namespaces are generated per user and branch to prevent collisions.
* **Staging**: The integration layer where code is automatically validated against a production-like environment.
* **Production**: The restricted "Source of Truth," accessible only through automated service principals.

> **Note**: While the standard flow follows a structured promotion, an **accelerated release path** exists. This "escape hatch" allows developers to bypass the formal release-please PR by using a chatbot command directly within their feature PR. Detailed logic for this is provided in Section 6.2.

## 3. CI/CD & The "Fast-Track" Release

This section outlines the lifecycle of a code change as it moves through the automated pipeline. The platform employs a dual-path deployment strategy: a standard, versioned release cycle for planned updates and a "Fast-Track" ChatOps path for emergency hotfixes and urgent deliveries.

    A -->|ChatOps /release| E[Prod Deployment]
    E -->|Success| F[Teams Notification]


```

### 3.2 The Deployment Workflow

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Pushes to any feature branch trigger automated linting and unit tests to ensure code quality before reaching the peer review stage.
2. **Staging Promotion**: Upon merging a Pull Request into the `main` branch, the bundle is automatically deployed to the Staging environment.
3. **Integration Testing**: Automated resource validation tests run against the Staging environment to confirm that the Databricks Jobs, DLT pipelines, and Dashboards function correctly in a production-like setting.
4. **Version Management**: The `release-please` action monitors the `main` branch, automatically aggregating commits to create a Release PR that handles Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and changelog updates.
5. **Production Release**: Merging the Release PR triggers the production workflow, deploying assets to the Production environment using a Service Principal identity for maximum security.
6. **Fast-Track "Escape Hatch"**: Developers can bypass the standard release cycle by commenting `/release` on an open PR. This triggers an immediate merge to `main` and initiates the Production deployment pipeline, providing an accelerated path for urgent changes.

### 3.3 Automated Versioning (SemVer)

We use **Release Please** to calculate version bumps based on Conventional Commits:

* **`fix:`** ➔ Patch (1.0.1)
* **`feat:`** ➔ Minor (1.1.0)
* **`feat!:`** ➔ Major (2.0.0)

**ChatOps Feedback Loop:**

* **Start**: "🚀 Fast-Track Release Initialized. I’m merging this feature and triggering the production release now."
* **Complete**: "✅ Release Complete. The Release PR has been merged, and the Production deployment is underway."
* **Failure**: "❌ Fast-Track Release Failed. I encountered an error... Please check GitHub Actions logs."

## 4. Standardized Project Blueprint

This layout is the mandatory standard for all current and future Databricks projects to ensure cross-team compatibility and ease of maintenance.

## 5. Configuration & Automation Components

### 5.1 The Coordinator (`databricks.yml`)

The Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) is a declarative framework that allows you to define your Databricks resources as code. The `databricks.yml` file acts as the primary "Skeleton," importing resources and defining global variables that the Databricks CLI uses to assemble the deployment package.

```yaml
bundle:
  name: marketing_analytics

include:
  - targets/*.yml
  - resources/*.yml


```

### 5.2 Target Overrides (`targets/`)

Targets provide environment-specific configurations. The CLI merges the base bundle with the specific target logic during deployment.

* **Sandbox**: For local iteration. Unique `root_path` prevents overwriting others' work.
* **Staging**: For final integration testing before production.
* **Production**: The locked environment using **Service Principal** identities.

**Variables and CLI Arguments:**
Variables allow for dynamic configuration. For example, in `sandbox.yml`, we use:

* `${workspace.current_user.short_name}`: To identify the developer.
* `${bundle.git_branch}`: To isolate different features.

You can override these via the CLI:
`databricks bundle deploy -t sandbox --var "catalog_name=experimental_catalog"`

### 5.3 Resource Definitions (`resources/`)

Files in this directory define the *what* of your project . By modularizing these, you can manage complex workflows in smaller, readable chunks.

The `resources/` directory defines the high-level Databricks objects (Jobs, DLT Pipelines, Dashboards) that the bundle will create and manage. By separating these into logical files, we maintain a clean and scalable configuration that can be easily reviewed during the PR process.

#### 5.3.1 Resource Categorization

Resources are split by type to prevent a single, unmanageable YAML file:

* **`dashboards.yml`**: Defines AI/BI dashboards, including layout, widgets, and data sources.
* **`jobs.yml`**: Configures multi-task workflows, including trigger schedules (cron), email notifications on failure, and cluster requirements.
* **`pipelines.yml`**: Specific to Delta Live Tables (DLT), defining materialization logic and data quality constraints (Expectations).

#### 5.3.2 Resource Overrides & Shared Logic

Because the `databricks.yml` coordinates these files, you can define a "base" resource and then apply environment-specific tweaks in your targets. For example, a job might run on a small shared cluster in **Staging** but move to a high-concurrency SQL Warehouse in **Production**.

#### 5.3.3 Implementation Example: `resources/jobs.yml`

```yaml
resources:
  jobs:
    daily_ingestion_job:
      name: "[${bundle.target}] Daily Sales Ingestion"
      tasks:
        - task_key: refresh_tables
          notebook_task:
            notebook_path: ../src/notebooks/ingest_sales.py
      job_clusters:
        - job_cluster_key: default_cluster
          new_cluster:
            spark_version: "14.3.x-scala2.12"
            node_type_id: "Standard_DS3_v2"
            num_workers: 2


```

## 6. The Command Interface (`Taskfile.yml`)

The Taskfile acts as a human-readable wrapper for complex CLI commands.

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  db-deploy:sandbox:
    desc: "Deploy to personal sandbox"
    cmds:
      - databricks bundle deploy -t sandbox

  db-deploy:staging:
    desc: "Deploy to staging (Internal use/CI)"
    cmds:
      - databricks bundle deploy -t staging

  db-deploy:prod:
    desc: "Deploy to production (Service Principal only)"
    cmds:
      - databricks bundle deploy -t prod --var "sp_id=${PROD_SP_ID}"


```

---

## 7. GitHub Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

Common files include `lint.yml` (PR validation), `staging.yml` (on push to main), and `production.yml` (on release).

**Example Production Deployment Snippet:**

```yaml
name: Production Deployment
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy DAB to Prod
        run: databricks bundle deploy -t prod
        env:
          DATABRICKS_HOST: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}
          DATABRICKS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DB_TOKEN }}
          PROD_SP_ID: ${{ secrets.PROD_SP_ID }}


```
