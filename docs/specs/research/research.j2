Act as a {{ role_title }}.

**Context:**
We are evaluating a technical shift for "{{ project_name }}".
Current Environment: {{ env_spec }}
Core Objective: {{ topic_spec }}

**Scope:**
Your research is strictly limited to the performance and architectural trade-offs between **{{ tech_a }}** and **{{ tech_b }}**.
Focus exclusively on:
1. Resource utilization (CPU/Memory/IO) within {{ env_spec }}.
2. Operational complexity and "day 2" maintenance.
3. Compatibility with existing constraints: {{ constraints | join(', ') }}.
*Do not suggest alternative technologies outside of this pair.*

**Outcome:**
Provide a "Trade-off Matrix" and a final recommendation. Format in Markdown for {{ preferred_editor }}.
