* Abstract
A brief (1-2 paragraph) overview of the project. What are we building, and why does it matter?

* Background
Why is this project being proposed? Provide context on the current state (e.g., "The current Databricks deployment relies on manual workspace imports").

* Goals & Non-Goals
** Goals
- [ ] Automate X using Taskfiles.
- [ ] Implement GitOps for web-app deployments.
** Non-Goals
- We are NOT migrating the legacy Jenkins server yet.
- We are NOT supporting multi-cloud at this stage.

* Proposed Architecture

Detailed description of the solution. Use sub-headings for components (e.g., Data Ingestion, K8s Networking, MLOps Hardware).

** Technical Specification
Describe how the components interact.

#+begin_src yaml :tangle example-config.yaml
# Example of a configuration or manifest snippet
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-service
#+end_src

* Cross-Cutting Concerns
** Security & Compliance
How are secrets handled? (e.g., Vault, ExternalSecrets). Mention the SRE standards for the Fedora/K8s environments.
** Observability
Logging, metrics, and tracing strategy.
** Scalability
How will the system handle a 10x increase in load?

* Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1: Infrastructure (Terraform/Ansible)
2. Phase 2: Core Platform (K8s/Databricks)
3. Phase 3: Application Migration

* Alternatives Considered
Briefly mention why other paths (e.g., using raw YAML instead of Helm) were rejected. Reference [[file:../adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.org][ADR-0001]] if applicable.

* Discussion & Feedback
[This section is for capturing notes from reviews or brain-dumping during the design phase.]
